# Main Purpose

# Part1
The application for the first homework assignment
This application will contain two different activities on two separate screens
The first activity will contain a textbox field that says "Tap to change Color" with 
a button that says "change color" below the field. 
The user can edit the text field to whatever they would like by using 
the keyboard on their device.
Once they have entered their input in the textfield, they can then press the button 
below it which will allow them to change the color to something random with each
button press. At the bottom of the screen, there will be a small text
prompt that will briefly show the hexdecimal format of the random color
that was outputted as a result of clicking the button. 

# Part2 
On the first screen, if the user were to click the button that says "switch" that is 
next to the color change button, the second activity with a drawing panel will be shown
along with tools below it. 
The user will be able to draw within the large box that is in the top center of the screen.
At the bottom there will be 3 seeker sliders that will allow the user to change rgb values for
the color of the drawing pen/finger.

Below the panel below the drawing panel will be where the color preview screen that will display
the color based on the rgb values that is selected to allow the user to know what color 
is currently selected. 
There is also a "clear" button that is at the right side of the screen that will
clear the drawing panel from any drawings the user has placed in it.


# External Libraries
For this application, I used a github repository from another user that provided with
open-sourced code. I was able to use this to help with setting up the colors 
and drawing panels needed for the second activity.

# Issues
Unfortunately, the application does not have all of the required components. 
I wasn't able to implement a saving function for any drawings that were created
by the user. 
Due to some previous issues, I had to start a new project since the previous one had some
problems changing between one activity to another. In order to test and find the
solution to the problem, I had to start a new project called "ColorApp2". 

# Screenshots
These are the screenshots that I took to show examples on how the application is suppose to look and how each function works.
